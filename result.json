        "It was good. It started slow so I thought I didn't need to pay attention at first but everything builds on the previous class so its important to really follow along and then things won't get too confusing.",
        "I really liked it, it was super fun. I liked that we didn't just do math programs but we worked with visualizations and things that we use daily to make the coding more fun and more relatable to real life.",
        "Learned what I wanted to, could've done a bit more with data analysis though",
        "Work is time consuming, and for me, it was difficult. Sara is a great professor and will help you if you ask for it though. Pay attention and follow lecture, it will save you.",
        "This course was very straightforward; the quizzes very directly reflected the content we were learning in class. There was so much support from Sarah and the TAs. I felt comfortable to make mistakes and ask questions.",
        "This class was very doable. I wouldn't say I really enjoyed it though. If there's one thing this class taught me it's that programming is not my thing. Besides that, great professor, great TA's, lectures were helpful, homework and quizzes were always doable.",
        "I really enjoyed this course. It is not too challenging. Sarah is a fantastic professor, and there are a lot of resources available to help such as the tutorial sections and office hours. Definitely recommend for a major requirement or Area II distro!",
        "LOVED this course!! Office hours are crucial for the projects and they help so much.",
        "This was a really great course. Sarah is a fantastic teacher and the workload was really manageable. There are also a lot of opportunities to get help if you need it.",
        "This course is really great if you want to get an introduction to programming! You really only need to get the basics of each unit down in order to succeed, but the course definitely gives you so many opportunities to explore and get creative.",
        "I had no prior experience with programming and Sarah is the absolute best. She made what we were learning feel applicable to things outside of this course, and she was so kind, thoughtful, and made the course concepts feel doable when I thought they would be daunting. Absolutely take this course with her if you're just interested in programming and want some sort of experience with it before you graduate.",
        "The instruction was really effective and the homeworks and projects pushed my coding knowledge farther.",
        "The professor is wonderful and understanding. She wants everyone to succeed and do well...rather than just creating a curve/grade distribution.",
        "This class is great!",
        "Sarah is one of the sweetest professors! She tries to make class as stimulating and enjoyable as possible, while also going through all the necessary materials. There were 2 weekly assignments, 2 projects, and 3 quizzes. The assignments were relatively straight forward and followed lectures closely. Many of them were in preparation for the projects and so they were helpful. The class also has a lot of peer mentors, and so you are constantly surrounded by resources and people to ask help for if you are stuck. This is a good intro class to Python if you are new to coding and just want to learn Python. Overall, I would recommend!",
        "SARAH IS THE BEST literally makes it so accessible even if you have no comp sci experience. sweetest professor and teaches so well",
        "Sarah is the best! I came into this class with 0 coding experience, and it was very manageable with the way the course was structured. Make sure to go to office hours if you are struggling because the projects are worth a decent bit of your grade.",
        "The class is really interesting and Sarah is an amazing professor. There is leniency built into the course to help you get the best grade possible. It is completely possible to get a good grade and learn a lot from this class if you take advantage of office hours.",
        "I walked into the course not really interested in CS and walked out with wanting to pursue CS way more than I thought I would. It is an easy class if you put the work into it (which isn\u2019t that much) but it also gives you confidence in your coding skills.",
        "I really liked the content but it was too much lecturing. In addition to the 3 50 minute classes a week, there was also a 50 minute tutorial (like a discussion) that was not advised on Canvas. More annoying than that, before most lectures, she would upload old lectures that take about 1 hour each. So instead of the class being 150 minutes, a week liked advertised on Canvas, it's much closer to 320 minutes. Overall good class and Van Wart is very nice and smart.",
        "As a student studying political science, history, and philosophy, I was a bit worried about exploring a subject outside my humanities comfort zone, but the course was designed for students with no prior coding experience, and though it was at times quite challenging, Professor Van Wart and the Peer Mentors did an amazing job explaining the course concepts clearly and logically. If you are taking this course, I would recommend going to office hours and the exam review sessions because they were extremely helpful. Everyone was very kind and willing to meet me where I was at based on my lack of coding experience, and I gained some very useful Python skills! I would recommend this course for anyone who it interested in starting to code!",
        "This course is very non\u2013CS\u2013major\u2013friendly!!! Do not be intimidated by this class even if you are not a CS person! I was not expecting to love this course but I actually had a great time! Sarah is a GREAT professor. She is an engaging lecturer and super knowledgeable. Definitely take this class if you're considering it",
        "Perfect teacher for the job. Very fun class! Would recommend!",
        "Professor Van Wart is so, so sweet and helpful. She always took time out of class to answer anyone's questions, and stayed long after class time was over to continue doing so. She was great at explaining CS concepts in easily understandable ways, and her enthusiasm helped a lot too. You're also guaranteed to get a 100+ on most assignments as long as you follow the parameters.",
        "This is a great introduction to programming and Python.",
        "This was by far my favorite course of the quarter. There wasn\u2019t any busy work. Sarah is extremely understanding and is actually interested in what she teaches I would definitely recommend",
        "The content was very well organized and easy to follow as a beginner in programming. Lectures were mostly engaging and tutorials were very helpful!",
        "Professor was spectacular. I had no business taking a CS class, but was very pleased with my time in this class. Not hard at all and the TAs are very helpful.",
        "this course is a great intro course! you get out of it what you put in. The prof was very understanding and the TAs were always available when you needed help!",
        "Sarah Van Wart is such an amazing professor. Because in a CS class you use your own computer, there are a lot of times individual issues with different students. She (and her team of TAs) is so helpful when it comes to solving problems, all you have to do is ask. My only gripe with the course is that you spend a lot of time working with simulations, shapes, etc. which doesn't have a lot to do with the data\u2013processing aspect of python \u2013 where my primary interest lay. I understand that these preliminary units are in place to teach you techniques in python, but I feel like there may be a more applicable way to do this.",
        "I took this class without any previous knowledge. I was afraid that things will be hard for me, but I learned everything from the scratch. The TAs and teachers were available to offer help with debugging our codes.",
        "I really enjoyed this course. I did spent a LOT of time on it, but that was 100% by choice... the course load is entirely manageable. When doing homework I felt as though I really was learning and not just completing things to get a grade. I spent so much time on the class because I really enjoyed it and so pursued random stuff in my own time. I had never coded prior to this class and now feel much more knowledgable about the subject.",
        "I really enjoyed this course. Sarah is an awesome teacher, and explains things in a way that students can understand, no matter their prior understanding of comp sci. I knew nothing about comp sci coming into this course, but the topics that were covered and the way we had to apply them through projects and homework really helped me understand the basics of Python. I highly recommend this course to anyone.",
        "Again, I learned so much in this class. I really loved it. It was nicely structured for flexibility\u2013I never attended lectures, I just watched them back whenever I had free time. It wasn't hard to get an A in this class if you work to understand the concepts. Some weeks had more work than others, but I really enjoyed the cool projects we did, so it wasn't too boring for me. Prof. Van Wart was great as well\u2014her lectures were very understandable and concise. I never really used my Peer Mentor, but I heard others had good experiences with them.",
        "This course has inspired me to pursue CS as a minor/major\u2013\u2013that's how dope it is! As long as you try just a little bit, it's very easy to be successful in CS\u2013110. The assignments are often creative and fun in addition to obviously being educational.",
        "I am glad I learned the fundamentals of coding. Now I feel I can go out and learn new languages.",
        "The professor was really motivating and super helpful in terms of choosing class content and keeping the class applicable to all students regardless of previous experience",
        "This class was amazing. Considering this was online, the professor did an amazing job of explaining the content while being open to answer questions after class. Lectures are recorded so you don't have to attend every class. The TAs in this class were amazing and always open to answering questions. If you're taking this course, make sure you utilized both the professor and TAs to the max, especially with the homework and projects.",
        "I think this class is great for everyone, even if you aren't interested in coding.",
        "Let me just say. I knew absolutely nothing about computers before this class. Literally nothing. Sarah is such an amazing professor and I feel like I learned SO MUCH. Even thought this was taught over Zoom, lectures were fun??? I thought she was super organized, professional, helpful, and I really can tell how much she loves what she does. Take this class it was honestly so much fun.",
        "A great intro to programming course. I came in which no knowledge of programming and it was very doable. If you have any experience with CS at all the course will be very easy for you. The second project involved generating spotify playlists and was fun and interesting. Prof Van Wart is super nice and energetic.",
        "This was a really good class\u2013\u2013although I thought it might be hard to follow a CS class in a remote setting, Professor Van Wart made it easy to follow and also was very approachable to get help from after class and in office hours.",
        "I loved this class. It was a perfect intro to coding with no prior experience and was very manageable",
        "Great course, Sarah is the best!",
        "This course was beyond amazing despite remote instruction. Sarah was extremely accommodating and seemed to be my only professor who recognized the pandemic. This course offers tons of help from weekly tutorials, to tons of office hours, etc. Lecture was worth attending and the workload was very manageable.",
        "Sarah and the TA are both very nice and clarify everything well!",
        "This class was amazing! Prof. Van Wart clearly cares about computer programming and her enthusiasm is infectious. I had no experience with or even interest in computer science, but this class has made me want to take more COMP SCI classes at Northwestern! If you are at all intrigued by computer science, take this course!",
        "Sarah is insanely organized and it's great, also a really fun professor",
        "Loved this class. I had heard great reviews about CS110, and they were all true\u2013\u2013I came to love coding in Python through this class. As an engineering student I highly recommend this class as an intro to programming, especially because Matlab coding is taught so poorly in EA1. Sarah is an amazing teacher who always makes class enjoyable and cares a lot about the students.",
        "Sara and the TAs were super helpful. Pretty easy and straightforward class.",
        "Sarah was super friendly and helpful and I really liked her class. Comp sci is very much out of my comfort zone, but she made it very accessible and I feel like I've learned a ton thanks to her. Also the TAs were great!!",
        "This was a great intro course and taught me how to use Python. I learned how to write code and other practical applications of Python. This was a super fun class! We wrote our own computer programs to make animations and recommendation apps!",
        "This course (a previously self\u2013proclaimed 'humanities person') made me want to double major/minor in CS! I really enjoyed learning Python, and Professor Van Wart is so engaging and helpful. Seeing our projects come to life was very rewarding.",
        "Sarah is the best professor I have had in my time so far at NU. This class is challenging but also has many opportunities for getting help. Highly recommend if you have any interest.",
        "Great course. Weekly homeworks, two quizzes, and two projects. Drops 1 homework and 1 quiz so don't need to do those if you do well on everything else. Overall, great class. Just show up to lecture and tutorial and homeworks should be a breeze.",
        "This class was good for a fourth class without too much work where you can be certain of doing well if you do the work. I didn't watch any of the recorded lectures or go to all the live ones, but the tutorial sections taught everything we needed to know for homework",
        "I LOVED this class and priofessor. I took it with an interest in pursuing Computer Science as my major and it was definitely a great introduction!!!",
        "This class was very helpful in getting me started learning Python. I thought that the pace was pretty good, and not too fast. There were tutorials and homework each week, 3 exams but only 2 of them counted, and 2 projects. I thought the projects were pretty interesting, the first was an interactive animation and the second was a recommendation app working with data from Yelp and Spotify.",
        "This is an awesome intro to coding. Sarah and the TAs are excellent, and your grade reflects the work you put in.",
        "I was able to learn a great deal, but the assignments were very difficult and required a lot of time and effort for a first\u2013time coder.",
        "Sarah was wonderful at teaching to nonmajors because she herself learned how to code after college. Office hours are held really often, and all the TAs are super patient and knowledgable.",
        "This class was very easy to be honest. It was also very fun and I looked forward to doing all the assignments and going to the class. Sarah also did a great job teaching the course and made it very enjoyable.",
        "This course was amazing and Sarah is awesome! I was really worried about this class because I had no previous computer science experience, but all of my worries were for not. I loved this course and learned so much from it! 10 out of 10",
        "This was a super chill and cool class. I learned a ton about the building blocks of python code and how to program/troubleshoot in python. Also, Professor Van Wart is awesome and she does a great job of making sure the class moves at a pace that is comfortable for everybody. She is super accommodating with office hours and so are all of the peer mentors/TAs. The quizzes in the class aren't bad at all and the homework assignments are generally pretty simple and easy except for the last few but they're doable.",
        "This was a great distro and pretty easy! I had no prior experience with coding whatsoever, but Professor Van Wart helped my understanding by going pretty slowly at first. The overall grades were determined by weekly submissions of tutorials (can drop 2), homework assignments (can drop 1), 2 out of 3 exams, and 2 large projects. I highly suggest going to office hours for help on any assignments and your tutorials because the peer leaders were very helpful. Overall, good experience with this class, but probably won't continue in any comp sci classes. Easy distro",
        "SARAH IS THE BEST \u2013 TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER IF YOU CAN AND WANT TO LEARN PYTHON BUT HAVE LIKE 0 EXPERIENCE WITH CODING!!! I learned a lot in this class even though it was via Zoom. Lectures were synchronous and recorded too. There's tutorial but they're actually helpful for learning the program and how to work through a lot of the hw. There are tons of office hours during the week and the peer mentors/ta have always been super helpful. Our grades consisted of tutorial assignments, hw, 2 projects (i.e. mideterm + final), and 3 quizzes (you can drop the lowest quiz grade though). Overall, everything was straightforward, didn't require too much time outside of class. If you just work hard and pay attention in the beginning to get a really firm grasp on everything, the latter end of the class shouldn't be difficult. Don't work on things last minute!! Always put in time for assignments so that if something goes wrong, you can pop into office hours to figure it out. But whatever the case, I think you'll have a lot of fun in this class with Sarah and feeling super cool when your codes runs and the programs that YOU WRITE actually work!",
        "I really enjoyed doing the projects because it uses what we learned and make amazing, unique code.",
        "If you have any significant computer programming experience then you should probably consider other cs classes. This class was great, but having done part of an MIT OpenCourseWare python course (as well as a programming class in freshman year of high school), I found most of the first half of this course redundant and all but the projects and the last few homework assignments felt like busywork. That being said, if you have little or no experience with programming this course will probably be great for you.",
        "I cannot say enough good things about Professor Sara. She is the most considerate, passionate, smart, and kind professor. I did not know much about computer science/coding other than taking a short course over the summer. I think Sara is very excited about the topic and made me want to learn more. She is understanding of students and has a very straight\u2013forward grading/teaching method. I am very glad I took this course.Regarding her remote teaching, it was the best of all the classes I took. She had a very active tutorial/discussion section style that allowed for students working together. She also had a synchronous/asynchronous lecture style, so that those who work better with synchronous classes could attend and those with time zone conflicts could watch the lecture later.I would say\u2013 I took this course to assess my interest in computer science and the possibility of majoring in it, but I do not think this class gives anything toward the comp sci major which was disappointing to learn towards the end of the course. It is simply an introduction and I think it also covers a distribution. I believe comp sci 111 is much more useful for the major, but this is a great intro for sure.",
        "I loved this class. Originally took it because I figured I should learn how to program (had zero prior knowledge) and discovered a new serious interest. Thinking about pursuing.",
        "The class is ridiculously time consuming, with pre\u2013lecture videos, weekly tutorials, homework, exams, and projects. But Sarah and the TAs are super accessible and helpful through it all. I really did learn a lot and I'm glad I took this class to fill a distro. Learned a valuable skill that I wouldn't have had the resources to learn otherwise.",
        "Everything is easy understand if you watch the pre recorded videos and attend lecture. You can get by with not showing up to lecture if you find the applications not that complicated. Sarah does a really good job of going over how each part of a program works. Working on the homework can be a little frustrating because you may not know where your errors are coming from, but going to office hours is always a good solution. The quizzes were very easy and do not cover the overly complicated stuff. Overall, not as bad as I thought is was going to be.",
        "I feel like there was an assignment/activity for everyone in this class. I personally enjoyed both of the bigger projects, but they were very different\u2013\u2013the first was an animation and the second was a web crawler.",
        "I'm really glad I took this! A really great intro to computer programming, Sarah is super easy to talk to and not intimidating.",
        "This class was fantastic! Professor Van Wart is truly incredible. She cares about her students as much as she cares about CS (which is a lot), and her passion for the subject made me excited to learn each new topic. I only took this class because it was a requirement for my Linguistics major, but I'm planning on taking more CS classes in the future because of how much I enjoyed it.",
        "Even though I had no interest in computer programming before, the class was pretty engaging. It was hard to learn sometimes because the structure of lectures seemed a bit unorganized.",
        "I loved this course. It seemed as though it's easier to take this course remotely than in\u2013person. There are so many opportunities for office hours. Sarah has the best intentions for her students and clearly wants you to walk away with a stronger understanding of programming.",
        "Extremely easy class, with many chances to improve if you make a mistake. Van Wart is easily one of the best professors at NU.",
        "I learned a lot about CS having no prior experience, but it's important to attend lecture to stay on track of new concepts that will be covered in homework and projects",
        "This course is amazing. Sarah is an awesome professor and such a kind human being. I have learned a lot about coding and discovered an interest in this area.",
        "I had almost no experience in computer programing prior to this course and was unaware for how many errors can occur and how to successfully troubleshoot said error. This course did a good job of taking this into account and there was help available almost all day for help on assignments. Instead of teaching on set way of accomplished task, we were encouraged to creatively apply concepts we learned and create unique solutions which immensely helped in developing an even better understanding of how to use everything learned in class.",
        "Sarah is the absolute best! She makes computer science so accessible and the projects you get to work on while seeming intimidating when you hear about them in the start are easy because of her instruction. The projects are a lot of fun to work on\u2013 an animation and a music/food recommendation app. Both of which have real life applications. It's very satisfying to see the results of your programming in a final product. Totally doable for beginners.",
        "I loved this class! Prof. Van Wart is one of the coolest professors I've had so far. She was very kind and understanding, and her lectures never felt like a chore. The TAs were also great, and tutorial time was a good opportunity to practice what was given in lecture, as well as get a head start on homework sometimes.Assignments were very light: A homework almost weekly that took maximum of an hour to finish (usually a lot less than that), tutorials weekly where you do the work during the tutorial session with your TA (where you can ask anything, as well as get instruction), and you can just submit it then and there, and 2 projects that might seem intimidating at first, but are actually not that hard/time\u2013consuming. The 3 quizzes were simple and to the point (and you can skip/drop one of them).All in all, this class was a great introduction to programming and computer science in general, so I definitely would recommend it to anyone not sure about CS.",
        "Sarah is a very kind person and professor and it is easy to do well in this class, just go to office hours. Not all of the lectures are super helpful, but they are all recorded so you can go back and watch just the parts you need.",
        "Tutorials were useful.",
        "I think the best part of this course was the practical assignments/applications that we had to do. Our second project tasked us with designing a recommendation app and it provided us a way to test our skills with a real life applications.",
        "I took this course because I wanted some knowledge of programming and not because of any requirement. I went into it with little experience, and the course was well paced. Definitely not a class you want to slack on, but if you keep up with the material, it's very doable to do well.",
        "I love this class. Even though I spent quite a few hours on the project, I still enjoyed the outcome.",
        "There are two major projects in this class and 3 quizzes. Sarah is so nice and her office hours are always helpful especially if there's a project coming up. TA office hours are a bit crowded especially on Thursdays and Fridays when assignments are due. Overall you will learn the basic logic of Python, a great start to CS.",
        "this class is so hard only take it if u have to. but the ta's and professor are absolutely fantastic. i just hate computer science",
        "This course was definitely interesting, I'm a fan of project\u2013based work, and I loved that we were always working toward a larger end goal. Overall, I found the course to be pretty easy \u2013 it shouldn't be too hard to get an A \u2013 but I still felt like I learned the content well.",
        "This class is fun if you have a friend in the class with you. You learn a lot and sarah is the greatest professor ever.",
        "I loved the tutorial sessions every week. Not only did it give us easy points as long as we attended, but it also gave us a chance to ask questions one on one with our TA since our class size was so large. I also loved that there were almost always office hours going on. Because there were so many TAs, every day there were at least 3 of 4 office hours we could attend and ask questions at.",
        "This is the class you need to take if you're interested in computer programming! It provides a fantastic launchpad and teaches you an actually useful programming language\u2013\u2013python. Plus Sarah is an icon and her dog, Seamus, is an angel uwu",
        "Very informational and understand teaching style. I learned a lot and this class didn't stress me out. I would recommend.",
        "IT WAS ACTUALLY A GOOD CLASS!!!!!!! Sarah is so nice and understanding!!! Students come to office hours at all points of their projects. Sarah has no judgment. THE CLASS IS BUILT SO YOU CAN SUCCEED. Lectures help with tutorials, tutorials help with homework, homework helps with your projects. Homework may take some time if you get stuck, but you can get help during office hours, which occur several times a day!!! There were 3 quizzes and you get to drop 1 (or you can replace your quiz 1 score with your quiz 2 score, or both for your quiz 3 score). You can drop 1 homework. You can drop 2 tutorials. Tutorials are easy points and help you learn!! There are extra credit opportunities. As long as you don't get behind and do what's expected, you can be relatively stress\u2013free about this class.Computer science seemed really scary to me at first, but this class is anything but scary!",
        "This class is one of those classes where you get what you give. If you put in enough work, you will get the grade you want. There's also a lot of opportunities for extra credit in homeworks or projects. The quizzes are also really relaxed, short, and not challenging. They just test your knowledge on things covered in lecture, and they don't have trick questions to stump you.",
        "coming in to the course without knowing one line of code. The course is informative and not overwhelmed for beginners. I end up with knowing how to write some simple (complex yo me) programs. It's a good start with cs. The professor is so nice, she wants you to learn the materials and not to worry too much about grades.",
        "This was a great course and Sarah is an amazing professor. Highly recommend! I did have some experience in java coming in but I think that someone who doesn't know anything about coding would be completely fine.",
        "Great intro class. Not too much work and keeps you interested in the subject.",
        "Great course, the professor was super nice and engaging and taught at a very reasonable pace. Quizzes/homework were extremely fair and you will learn a lot from this class.",
        "I thought this class was going to be very hard because I had no other computer programming experience but I absolutely loved this class. Sarah is amazing and makes learning comp sci fun. The projects are actually really enjoyable. This is probably one of my favorite classes I've take at NU.",
        "great",
        "I LOBE SARAH. She is so accommodating for deadlines and other students' needs. You get to drop at least one tutorial and he and there are SO MANY OH that it is so easy to meet with the professor or a TA. Some projects were a bit challenging but you can definitely do it on your own or easily get help if you need it.",
        "This is a great intro class for computer science. The projects are very fun and show multiple aspects of computer programming and Python. If you already have some background in computer programming, this class will likely be pretty slow and easy. Professor Van Wart is super helpful and really cares about the students, and works well with the TAs. The class was a little disorganized as lectures were supposed to be watched before class but were posted at random times.",
        "The Professor was amazing and Office Hours were always available. Projects were enjoyable and deadline were always stated well in advanced. Very well organized class."
