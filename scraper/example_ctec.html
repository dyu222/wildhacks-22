The assignments were relatively straight forward and followed lectures closely. Many of them were in preparation for the projects and so they were helpful. The class also has a lot of peer mentors, and so you are constantly surrounded by resources and people to ask help for if you are stuck.

In addition to the 3 50 minute classes a week, there was also a 50 minute tutorial (like a discussion) that was not advised on Canvas. More annoying than that, before most lectures, she would upload old lectures that take about 1 hour each.

If you are taking this course, I would recommend going to office hours and the exam review sessions because they were extremely helpful.

Because in a CS class you use your own computer, there are a lot of times individual issues with different students. She (and her team of TAs) is so helpful when it comes to solving problems, all you have to do is ask. My only gripe with the course is that you spend a lot of time working with simulations, shapes, etc. which doesn't have a lot to do with the data–processing aspect of python – where my primary interest lay. I understand that these preliminary units are in place to teach you techniques in python, but I feel like there may be a more applicable way to do this.</td>

She had a very active tutorial/discussion section style that allowed for students working together. She also had a synchronous/asynchronous lecture style, so that those who work better with synchronous classes could attend and those with time zone conflicts could watch the lecture later.<br>I would say– I took this course to assess my interest in computer science and the possibility of majoring in it, but I do not think this class gives anything toward the comp sci major which was disappointing to learn towards the end of the course.
